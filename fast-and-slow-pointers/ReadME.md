## Fast & Slow Pointers

Intuition:

Instead of moving two pointers at the same speed, we let one pointer move twice as fast as the other.

If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer.

Great for:

Detecting cycles in linked lists or arrays.

Finding the middle of a list.

Detecting circular dependencies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Problems

1. [Easy] Find Middle of Linked List
2. [Easy] Happy Number (detect cycle in number transformation)
3. [Medium] Linked List Cycle I
4. [Medium] Linked List Cycle II (find cycle start)
5. [Medium] Palindrome Linked List (reverse second half using slow pointer)
6. [Hard] Circular Array Loop
7. [Hard] Find Duplicate Number (Floydâ€™s algorithm on array)
