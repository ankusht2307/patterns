## Dynamic Programming (DP)

DP is about solving problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and storing results (memoization/tabulation) to avoid recomputation.

## Intuition

- DP = recursion + memoization.

- Two main approaches:

  - Top-Down (Memoization): Think recursively, store answers.
  - Bottom-Up (Tabulation): Build from base cases iteratively.

- Identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting base cases (like amount=0, empty string).
- Using recursion without memoization â†’ exponential blowup.
- Mixing up index vs length in DP arrays.
- Storing unnecessary states (optimize space if possible).
