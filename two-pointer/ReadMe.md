## Two Pointers Pattern

Intuition:

Instead of brute force with nested loops, we can place two markers (left, right) to move intelligently through the array.

Works best with:

Sorted arrays (because we can eliminate half of the search space).

Strings/arrays where shrinking/expanding is needed.

Problems like searching pairs/triplets, reversing, merging.

## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Problems

(From Easy â†’ Hard, sorted by increasing complexity)

1. [Easy] Reverse Vowels of a String
2. [Easy] Move Zeroes
3. [Medium] Two Sum II (Input Sorted)
4. [Medium] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
5. [Medium] Container With Most Water
6. [Medium] Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)
7. [Medium] Pair with Target Sum
8. [Hard] 3Sum Closest
9. [Hard] Trapping Rain Water
